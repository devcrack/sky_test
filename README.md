## Description

This project creates a small backend using the NestJS framework. 
It simply exposes a GET endpoint "/test/users", 
which provides a response with a body containing a list of users 
with some properties. The users are sorted by Id in descending order. 
In addition to this, when making the "/test/users" request, 
the obtained users are published in rabbitMQ.
